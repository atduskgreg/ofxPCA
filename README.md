## ofxPCA

An in-progress OpenFrameworks addon that will implement the Principal Component Analysis dimensionality reduction technique. This technique is useful for finding the axes that explain the most variation in data. This can be used for finding the orientation of a set of points or the normal to a cluster of unoriented points.

This library uses the [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) linear algebra library for its matrix routines.

It is also in-progress and won't be done for a few more days. :)
